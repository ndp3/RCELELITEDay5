This project shows the final day's work in the RCEL ELITE Tech Summer Camp, where I was a paid Virtual Live Instructor. In a week's worth of time, we took a group of 5-10 high school students from absolutely no assumed knowledge of programming to using a machine learning library (Scikit-Learn) and a dataset imported from a Climate Sensor Tag. We also taught them about other Internet of Things topics, Machine Learning concepts, and some basic Python syntax and phrases.
