Let's walk through what we expect you to do in this file:

1. Use your ```get_data()``` function to read in weather data from the CSV file under Lesson 1! Then, be sure to scale the data like you did when training!
2. In Lesson 2, use the plotting we provided in ```mylib.py``` to visualize the model applied to new data. Please play around with the plotting capabilities, colors, etc. 
3. Load the model and scaler you trained by running the ```IsolationForestTraining.py``` file using the ```pkl.load()``` function.
