### Now that we've learned basic Python, let's start covering some Machine Learning Basics!

As was covered in your video lectures, Python has increasingly become the programming language for science and, specifically, machine learning. Because of this, there are numerous Python libraries that handle a lot of the complex math/theory behind many machine learning algorithms. However, it is <i>imperative</i> you understand the logic behind the difference between various algorithms in order to understand how to apply them. This often comes with practice, but we'll do our best to get you on the right foot!
